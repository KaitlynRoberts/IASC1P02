	<h3><em>Makeup</em>, 2016</h3>
	<p class="p">	I have chosen to create this drawing out of makeup to portray the symbolic meaning of women “painting” their faces. Even in earlier years, women wore makeup. In some religions, makeup is used to protect eyes from sunlight and the evil eye. Many cultures, like ancient Egypt and modern India, believe the evil eye causes bad luck or grievance. Today in western culture, women wear makeup to perfect their flaws and enhance their feminine beauty. Wearing makeup is not a necessity, but it allows us to enrich our beauty that may not be as noticed without it. Artists do the same thing with their artwork. They make viewers focus on what needs to be concentrated on for their message to be absorbed. They take out what is not important and detail what is. Women use makeup the same way by usually amplifying the focus on their eyes.</p>
	<p class="p">I used different shades of foundation for the background of the drawing to represent the many types of women who wear makeup. Makeup is worn in almost every culture and religion, sometimes even by men.</p>
	<p class="p">The drawing is abstract and geometric as makeup doesn’t take away the realistic image of faces, but changes the appearance of them. Makeup stylizes are faces, exaggerating certain features like enhanced cheekbones or longer eyelashes.</p>
	<p class="p">The images of eyes form the iris pull the viewer’s focus toward the image even more, creating the main focal point. The eyes are of different people from different ethnicities and backgrounds. This also represents the types of people all over the world who wear makeup. It shows that all of us everywhere are constantly trying to improve and perfect ourselves. We all want to be perfect; it’s in our nature. Makeup helps to enhance that, forcing people to view what we love about ourselves.</p>
